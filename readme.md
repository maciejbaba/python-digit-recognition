# Python Digit Recognition AI

This project is a Python-based AI that can recognize digits. It uses machine learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of handwritten digits and then uses that model to predict the digit in new images.

## Features

- Digit recognition: The AI can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images.
- Training and testing: The project includes scripts for training the model on a dataset and testing its accuracy.
- User interface: The AI can be used through a simple user interface, allowing users to input images and get the predicted digit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-digit-recognition.git
```

1. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Train the model:

```shell
python train.py
```

This script will train the model on the provided dataset.

1. Test the model:

```shell
python test.py
```

This script will evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on a test dataset.

1. Use the AI:

```shell
python predict.py
```

This script will prompt you to input an image file and display the predicted digit.
