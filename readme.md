# Python Digit Recognition AI

This project is a Python-based AI that can recognize digits. It uses machine learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of handwritten digits and then uses that model to predict the digit in new images.

## Features

- Digit recognition: The AI can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images.
- Training and testing: The project includes scripts for training the model on a dataset and testing its accuracy.
- User interface: The AI can be used through a simple user interface, allowing users to input images and get the predicted digit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-digit-recognition.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow matplotlib
```
